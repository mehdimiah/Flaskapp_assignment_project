# Flaskapp_assignment_project
This formed of a project which a brief was given, creating a site exactly as stated by the brief

We were directed to create a super-geocoder, it is able to take ONLY CSV files (example file attached).
the webapp will then take this CSV file, maipulate the data and add two columns longitude and latitude to the CSV file.
the table will then be available for download after, the table is also printed on the page to display the new, edited
csv table.
